## Project Overview

Built using React.js, Redux, and Firebase. This is my first React Project after coming from a jQuery background. 
I started building this before learning hooks, so a lot of the components are still class components. Features are:
  *Write song lyrics in browser
  *Record audio files in browser
  *Organize songs in folders
  *Built in guitar tuner in nav page on desktop site
  *Built in metronome in nav page on desktop site
  *Synonym and Rhyming dictionary built in editor page on Desktop site

## Current Limitations
I built this to be an application that is used by Songwriters, but I am not willing to invest in the infrastructure unless there is true interest. There are no limitations to the amount of songs / folders you can create, but you can only upload recordings that are less than 10mb. Recordings are saved as .mp3, which should prevent this from being a huge problem as .mp3 files are pretty small.
